#Â aiovectortiler

aiovectortiler is an asynchronous micro vector tile application that serves data from PostGIS.

It is based on the [Utilery](https://github.com/tilery/aiovectortiler) package created by Yohan Boniface.

Documentation: http://aiovectortiler.readthedocs.org/

TODOs:
- Note that in its current state this package should work in the majority of cases.
- Tests are pending reimplementation for compatibility with the aiohttp ecosystem.
- Plugins need to be further developed and checked.
